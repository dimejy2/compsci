Databases notes
===============

Candidate key (or simply "key"):
    A set of fields is a (candidate) key for a relation if
    1. no two distinct tuples can have the same values in all the key
       fields; and
    2. this is not true for any subset of the key.
    i.e. a candidate key is a minimum set of fields which determines all the
    others.

Superkey:
    A set of fields which is a superset of a (candidate) key.

Primary key:
    If there's more than one key for a relation, then one is chosen by the
    Database administrator to be the primary key. It is one of the candidate
    keys; the primary key is only a declaration to the database and does not
    change the functional dependencies.

Prime attribute/field:
    A field which is a member some the set of fields which constitutes a
    candidate key.

Foreign key:
    A set of fields in one relation that is used to refer uniquely to one
    particular tuple in another relation. This is done by setting the foreign
    key fields to the values of the primary key fields in the referenced
    relation. It's a bit like a pointer or object reference.


Alternative definitions of normal forms
---------------------------------------

Normal forms:

2NF: consider the following example: relation R(A,B,C,D) where {A,B} is
the key. If there is a functional dependency B->C in this relation, it
is not in 2NF. This could be fixed by decomposing into two relations,
R(A,B,D) with key {A,B} and S(B,C) with key {B}.

3NF, BCNF:

Consider a relation R(U) with a set of attributes U and a set of
functional dependencies F. (F+ is the transitive closure of F)

A dependency X->A in F+ is "transitive" if A is not an element of X (it
is non-trivial), and if there exists some Y, a subset of U, such that A
is not an element of Y, and X->Y is in F+, and Y->A is in F+, and Y->X
is not in F+.

A dependency X->A in F+ is "direct" if it is not transitive.

3NF: R is in 3NF if: for all attributes A which are not members of a
candidate key, and for all keys K, K->A is direct.

BCNF: R is in BCNF if: for all attributes A (whether members of a key or
not) and for all keys K, K->A is direct.
